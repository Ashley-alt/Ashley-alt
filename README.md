<b>Hey there 👋</b>

I’m Ashley, a Frontend-focused software engineer based in the UK.

I’m focused on building and improving my frontend skills.

If I want to understand something better, I’ll usually build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is React and TypeScript, with a growing focus on CSS and UI work.  

I’m currently revamping my GitHub after some time away and using it to build consistently and learn in public.

You’ll find a mix of small frontend projects, experiments, and practice apps here.  
Check out the pinned repositories below.

Fun facts:
- I like the Gym
- I enjoy photography and visual storytelling  
- I like building things from scratch
- Anime is my guilty pleasure
